# REVERSAL-SEPARATED DATA FOR PRED1
# Status: NO TRUE REVERSAL-SEPARATED DATA FOUND
#
# This file contains the closest available proxy data:
# - TR&D-96: 26 individual G measurements over 10 years (NOT reversal-separated within runs)
# - Nature 2018: 36 measurements (ToS/AAF method-separated, NOT CW/CCW reversal-separated)
#
# The reversal_flag column is set to "averaged" for all rows because:
# All publicly available G measurements report reversal-averaged values only.
# True CW/CCW or near/far separated G values are never published.
